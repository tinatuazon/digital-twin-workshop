I’d set up event broadcasting in Laravel to trigger notifications, and use JavaScript on the frontend to listen for these events and update the UI instantly. This approach is reliable, integrates well with my existing tech stack, and provides a smooth user experience. I’m always open to learning more advanced solutions as project needs grow."
